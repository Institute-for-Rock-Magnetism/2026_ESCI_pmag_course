        "# Magnetic Anisotropy\n",
        "\n",
        "In Chapter 4 of *Essentials of Paleomagnetism*, Lisa Tauxe introduces the concept of **Magnetic Anisotropy**—the phenomena that magnetic moments have a preferred direction within a crystal. This preference is what allows assemblages of magnetic minerals to record Earth's magnetic field.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Class Structure:**\n",
        "In this session, we will explore the competition between different forms of magnetic energy focusing on the mineral magnetite:\n",
        "1.  **Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy:** The barriers to the rotation of magnetization as a resulted of the crystal lattice. We will focus on magnetite.\n",
        "2.  **Shape Anisotropy:** How the elongated shape of a grain can creates result in strong anisotropy.\n",
        "3.  **The \"Tug of War\":** Determining how much a grain needs to be elongated for shape anisotropy to overcome magnetocrystalline anisotropy.\n",
        "4.  **Time & Temperature:** Determining the smallest grain that can hold a record for a billion years.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Homework Assignment:**\n",
        "At the end of this notebook, you will apply these concepts to answer a specific research question:\n",

        "Through a magnetic grain seeking to minimize its energy it naturally aligns with specific \"easy\" directions. This directional preference creates stability, preventing the magnetization from drifting freely and is therefore central to magnetic mineral assemblages being magnetic recorders."
